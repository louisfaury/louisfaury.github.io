I am a PhD student at [Criteo AI Labs](https://ailab.criteo.com) and [LTCI lab](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/recherche/laboratoires/laboratoire-traitement-et-communication-de-linformation-ltci) at TélécomParisTech in Paris, France. My research namely focus on derivative free optimization and learning from bandit feedback. Recently, I have focused mostly on structural bandits. 

I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique in 2018 where I studied optimal control and statistics. I also got a master's degree (MsC) at EPFL in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
